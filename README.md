<!-- FAQ (optional) -->

## ❓ FAQ (OPTIONAL) <a name="faq"></a>


- **What to do when Pull Request Github Actions fail?**

  - You need to check the `linters.yml` file for correct versions.

- **What is the process to open Pull Request?**

  - The process to open a Pull Request is to first make changes in the features branch and not the main branch. Commit and push changes to the feature branch to get approved and then merge it to the main branch.
